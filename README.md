# Brain_Tumor_Classification
Multiclass classification of brain MRI images using a custom CNN and EfficientNetB0 transfer learning. The project includes full preprocessing, data augmentation, model comparison, and evaluation with accuracy/F1 metrics. Grad-CAM heatmaps are generated to provide interpretability and highlight tumor-specific regions in MRI scans.
